## Decision
- Decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help data analyticsÂ director understand both the skills.

## Challenge given
- To run SQL queries to answer 10 Ad-hoc requests for which AtliQ Hardware needs business insights. For more information click on the [Link](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).
